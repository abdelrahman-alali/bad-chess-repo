# bad-chess-repo

This is a text based python chess game in which the basic chess rules (checks, checkmate, en passant and castling) have been implemented and only valid moves are accepted; however, stalemate and draws by repetition haven't been taken into account. I tried adding them but I started getting confused. To move a pice, the current position of that piece according to the coordinates on the board and the position that it would move towards should be typed in respectively and separated by 1 space in the following format: "D2 D4".
